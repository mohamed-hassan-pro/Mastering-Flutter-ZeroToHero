Q3
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to
search target in nums.
- If target exists, return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
- The algorithm must run in O(log n) time complexity.
Examples:
- Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9 → Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4.
- Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2 → Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums, so return -1.
