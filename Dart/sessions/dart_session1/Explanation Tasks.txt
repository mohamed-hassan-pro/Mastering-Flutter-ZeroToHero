1. Explain the purpose of the main function in Dart.
    The main function is the entry point of every Dart application
    It is the first function that gets executed when you run the program
    Without a main function, the program doesn't know where to start

2. Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart.

  Explicitly Typed:
    The type of the variable is explicitly declared (e.g. int, String, bool)
    The type cannot change after assignment

  Var:
    It is a keyword to declare variables
    If you assign a value immediately, Dart infers the type and it becomes fixed
    However, if you declare a var without an initial value
    it allows assigning values of different types later (similar to dynamic)

  Dynamic:
    We use dynamic when we do not know the data type at compile time.
    It is essential when handling data coming from external sources like APIs
    JSON files, or large datasets where the type might vary
